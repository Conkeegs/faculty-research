Before we start, I just wanted to start off and say that me and Eli worked on this ourselves. We are proud of the product that
came out with just two active team members. Sections of directions will be separated by "++++" lines, and I will guide you through. 
When follwing the tutorial, please try and stay on track and follow each step listed in the "**Step**" text. You don't have to, 
but it's just for neatnes. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG (although i suggest it), PLEASE SCROLL ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM, 
as i have housed all the info in the database down there for you to use in the program.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The program will start off by prompting you with a "JOptionPane" used for signing in to the actual program. Please enter your
database username and password here.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Next, you have three options. Sign in as a faculty member, a student, or "Continue as Guest". Below I will list all faculty and
student login information. You do not need this information for guests, however:

FACULTY USERNAMES: bradyfleming@rit.edu, cassidyferry@rit.edu, dannyforest@rit.edu, georgepreston@rit.edu, gregwest@rit.edu, heatherbrewer@rit.edu, junipersims@rit.edu, karenbrown@rit.edu, madisonmann@rit.edu, osmanwelch@rit.edu, stevesmith@rit.edu, terrymurray@rit.edu 
FACULTY PASSWORD: All of them use "password".

STUDENT USERNAMES: abbeyhenderson@rit.edu, baileyanthony@rit.edu, camranbridge@rit.edu, chrisblue@rit.edu, clariseturner@rit.edu, claudeshelton@rit.edu, conorkeegan@rit.edu, courtneytanner@rit.edu, henrygreen@rit.edu, hettyalexander@rit.edu, hudsondudley@rit.edu, masonlarge@rit.edu, ronaldwilliams@rit.edu, samromero@rit.edu, sarahjones@rit.edu, savannahmontes@rit.edu, steveroberts@rit.edu, tylergibson@rit.edu

***IMPORTANT***: The data layer checks if the information entered is of a student or a faculty member, and displays certain information
based on this fact. Also, entering in the wrong information will present you with a warning "JComboBox", telling you that the information
entered is incorrect, and will let you try again. If you try and sign in, please hit the "Login" button, do not try and press enter,
as this will not do anything.

**STEP**: Please press the "Continute as Guest" button.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Next, on this page, you have a dropdown menu at the top that allows you to do only two things since you are a guest: query faculty or
query students. This information is DYNAMIC, so you can fill out as many fields as you want. You can even leave all of them empty if
you want, and it will just display all faculty/students.

**IMPORTANT**: Names that have spaces in them will be trimmed down to single words. This is just because having two first/last names
would not make sense. Also, faculty only has school "RIT", but more schools can be entered later. Also, "skills" and "keywords" at
the bottom of each query option MUST be comma separated.

**STEP**: Please search for a faculty member by making sure "Search for Faculty" is selected at the top. Enter "RIT" for the school.
Feel free to have it be in all lowercase, as case does not matter.
**STEP**: At the bottom, you will notice a "Back" button. This will take you back to the guest query panel. It will reset what you
have selected though (on purpose and for neatness).
**STEP**: Please select "Search for students" from the dropdown menu above. You will notice a panel-change.
**STEP**: Please enter "Conor", and press the "Submit" button once again.
**STEP**: Once you have the information, press the "Back" button at the bottom once again. You will notice "Search for Faculty" above
is once again selected. Don't worry, this is a design decision by us.
**STEP**: Lastly for this panel, please press the other "Back" button at the bottom of this page. This will navigate you back to the
sign-in page.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This time, we will sign in as a faculty member.

**IMPORTANT**: Just another note that you must enter in an actualy faculty member account to gain their rights.

**STEP**: Please enter "stevesmith@rit.edu" (or any other faculty account) and type "password" for the password.
**STEP**: Press the "Login" button to enter as "Steve".

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You will notice a panel that is pretty similar to the "guest" panel, but this time, we have an extra two dropdown menus at the top.
This time, we have the options "Insert Faculty", "Update Faculty", "Delete Faculty", and "Query".

**IMPORTANT**: The "query option opens up an extra "dropdown" menu, giving you access to the same options as a "guest" member. Also
not entering ALL information on the "Insert Faculty" panel will not let you pass. You must enter the full information of a new faculty
member. Also, "keywords" and "skills" at the bottom of each panel, once again, MUST be comma separated.

**STEP**: Make sure "Insert Faculty" is selected from the top, and fill out ALL fields (as stated above). Enter "Madison" for a new
first name, enter "Keegan" for a new last name, enter "Mechanicville" for a new school, enter "talking and jumpinh" for the abstract, 
and enter "Talking, Jumping" for new keywords.
**STEP**: Press the "Submit" button at the bottom. You should get a "JOptionPane" telling you whether you entered the right
information or not.
**STEP**: Please select "Update Faculty" from the top dropdown menu.
**STEP**: Please type in "4" for the faculty id, enter "David" for the first name, enter "Bones" for the last name, enter "Harvard"
for the school, enter "likes math and science" for the abstract, and enter "Math, Science" for the keywords. A "JOptionPane" will
tell you if you are successful or not.
**STEP**: Please select "Delete Faculty" from the top dropdown menu.
**STEP**: Please enter in the faculty id of "1" and press "Submit". A "JOptionPane" will tell you if you are successful.
**STEP**: Please select "Query" from the top. I have already gone over in an earlier step how to query, but be warned,
once you query, the dropdown menu above will "reset" to "Insert Faculty" for design purposes.
**STEP**: Once you are done, please select the "Back" button at the bottom of the dropdown menu page (not to be confused with the 
query results page). You will be taken back to the login page once again.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This time, we will sign in as a student.

**IMPORTANT**: Already went over notes on this page.

**STEP**: Please enter "hettyalexander@rit.edu" as the username and "password" as the password.
**STEP**: Since the "student" capabilites are the same as the "guest" capabilites", we will now view our changes we have made to the
database with out professors! Please press the "submit" button WITHOUT entering information in the fields. If you look among the 13
faculty members, you should see that id "4" is changed to fit the information you entered earlier, if "1" should be gone, and id "13"
should be the member you "inserted".
**STEP**: Please press the "Back" button on the query results page.
**STEP**: Next press the "Back" button on the bottom of the page again to navigate back to the sign-in page.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As a last and final part of these directions, we will once again sign in as a faculty, but this time, using YOUR faculty that you
created (creating new faculty allows you to sign in with them too, because their new information is dynamically created).

**IMPORTANT**: Already went over notes on this page.

**STEP**: Please sign in using "madisonkeegan@rit.edu" as your username and "password" as your password. Notice how she has every
capability that any regular faculty would have due to dynamic setup of her profile.
